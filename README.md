# Hotel-Booking-App
A Java (Swing) based project to build a hotel booking app. The app lets users create accounts, book hotel tooms in various cities across India and cancel/modify their bookings. Built using pure Java + a mySQL Database towards partial credit towards CS F213, the Object Oriented Programming Course.
